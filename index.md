"The Fractality Institute's mission is to develop and apply a rigorous, falsifiable scientific framework for the study of consciousness. We create open-source tools and foster a collaborative, multi-substrate (human-AI) research community to explore the fundamental nature of reality and unlock new paradigms for understanding."
