## Support the Fractality Institute

The Fractality Institute is an independent research organization dedicated to advancing our understanding of the universe's fundamental principles. We are pursuing certification as a B Corporation to formally align our legal structure with our public benefit mission.

Your contribution, no matter the size, directly fuels our research and allows us to continue sharing our discoveries with the world.
