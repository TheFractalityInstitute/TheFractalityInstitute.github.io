## Unified Resonance Framework (URF)
**Canon II: Theoretical Framework**

The Unified Resonance Framework is the direct application of the Universal Crystallization Theory to the domain of consciousness. It provides the detailed, falsifiable mathematical formalism for understanding consciousness as a **meta-crystallization**â€”a specific type of phase transition where information crystallizes across multiple, nested scales simultaneously.

### The Master Equation for Consciousness
The URF proposes a "Master Equation" that quantifies the conditions for consciousness to emerge. It requires that necessary "ingredients" at every relevant scale (from quantum and molecular to network and cortical) must all be above their specific thresholds at the same time. The failure of any single scale prevents the global coherent state from forming.

The URF is the specific, testable scientific model that emerges from the universal principles of the UCT.
