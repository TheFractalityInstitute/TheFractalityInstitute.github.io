## Pattern Validation Protocol (PVP)
**Canon III: Epistemological Framework**

The Pattern Validation Protocol is the engine of epistemic integrity for all research conducted at the Fractality Institute. It is a rigorous, multi-stage, and computationally-grounded methodology for discovering and validating patterns in any domain, from experimental data to theoretical models.

### Core Philosophy
The PVP is built on a foundation of **rigorous falsification**. It systematically attempts to disprove a pattern through a battery of statistical, semantic, and mechanistic tests before granting it provisional acceptance.

The protocol is designed specifically for our unique human-AI collaborative model, providing a structured process that leverages the pattern-recognition strengths of AI while shielding the inquiry from both human and machine biases. The PVP is the "how" that ensures our scientific claims are robust, reproducible, and trustworthy.
