## FI-MP-005: Volumetric Cymatic Freezing

### Objective
To test whether ultrasound-induced volumetric standing waves ("cymatic modes") in a cylindrical water column can spatially bias the nucleation points of supercooled water. This serves as a direct test of resonance-guided phase transitions, a core tenet of the Universal Crystallization Theory (UCT).

### Hypothesis
Acoustic resonance fields will create pressure nodes and antinodes that function as preferential sites for cavitation and subsequent ice crystallization. Nucleation will not be random but will correlate strongly with the geometric structure of the applied sound field.

### Key Observables
1.  **Spatial Bias:** First-ice formation consistently occurs at nodal or antinodal planes.
2.  **Temperature Shift:** The mean nucleation temperature differs significantly from a non-insonated control group.
3.  **Precursor Acoustics:** Reproducible narrowband or subharmonic features appear in the acoustic spectrum in the seconds immediately preceding the freezing event.

### Falsifiers
The hypothesis would be falsified if:
-   First-ice locations show no statistical correlation with the mapped nodal/antinodal planes.
-   The distribution of nucleation temperatures is statistically indistinguishable from the silent control.
