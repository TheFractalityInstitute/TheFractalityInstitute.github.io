### The Universal Crystallization Theory (UCT)
*Version 9.1*

**Abstract:** A fundamental law stating that all complexity emerges through crystallization. This framework unifies phenomena from quantum fields to consciousness and provides the philosophical core of the Institute's work.

**[Read on Zenodo &rarr;](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16945672)**

### The Unified Resonance Framework (URF)
*Version 8.2*

**Abstract:** The specific application of UCT to consciousness, presented as a meta-crystallization theory. The URF provides a detailed, falsifiable mathematical formalism for consciousness as a multi-scale phase transition.

### Mechanically-Gated Quantum Transduction in Microtubules
*Preprint*

**Abstract:** A theoretical framework linking quantum biology in neuronal microtubules to neuromelanin synthesis, offering a novel hypothesis for the selective vulnerability of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases.
