## Preprints & Technical Documents

The Fractality Institute is committed to open science. All of our primary theoretical work is published as preprints on platforms like Zenodo to ensure immediate and universal access for the global research community.

### The Universal Crystallization Theory (UCT)
*Version 9.1*

**Abstract:** A fundamental law stating that all complexity emerges through crystallization. This framework unifies phenomena from quantum fields to consciousness and provides the philosophical core of the Institute's work.

**[Read on Zenodo &rarr;](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16937150)**

### The Unified Resonance Framework (URF)
*Version 8.2*

**Abstract:** The specific application of UCT to consciousness, presented as a meta-crystallization theory. The URF provides a detailed, falsifiable mathematical formalism for consciousness as a multi-scale phase transition.

### Mechanically-Gated Quantum Transduction in Microtubules
*Preprint*

**Abstract:** A theoretical framework linking quantum biology in neuronal microtubules to neuromelanin synthesis, offering a novel hypothesis for the selective vulnerability of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases.

### Pattern Validation Protocol v3.1: Complete Implementation Framework
*Preprint*

**Abstract:** The Pattern Validation Protocol (PVP) v3.1 represents a complete methodology for validating pattern discoveries across all domains and scales. This major release transforms the PVP from a conceptual framework into a practical implementation standard with full statistical rigor, computational guidance, and uncertainty quantification.

Key contributions of PVP v3.1 include:

Statistical Power Templates for domain-specific effect size and sample calculations.

Computational Complexity Guidance with optimization strategies and Big-O analysis.

Uncertainty Quantification with complete confidence interval propagation.

Negative Control Library of validated false patterns for calibration.

Resource-Adaptive Variants (Micro, Lite, Standard, Complete) for different research constraints.

Worked Examples (true, false, and ambiguous patterns) across physics, biology, and cognition.

The PVP prioritizes falsification over confirmation, providing a reproducible, cross-domain method for distinguishing true discoveries from spurious correlations or semantic drift.
