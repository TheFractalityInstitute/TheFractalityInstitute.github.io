## FI-GOV-IN-2025-001: Document Identification & Versioning Protocol

### 1. Preamble

To ensure clarity, consistency, and long-term archival integrity, all official documents produced by The Fractality Institute must adhere to a standardized identification system. This protocol establishes the formal naming convention for all research, theoretical, and operational outputs.

### 2. The Standard Identifier Format

The canonical identifier for any Institute document follows the structure:

`FI-[DOMAIN]-[TYPE]-[YEAR]-[SEQ]`

#### 2.1. Domain Codes
The `[DOMAIN]` code specifies the primary research area of the document.
- **UCT:** Universal Crystallization Theory & Core Frameworks
- **URF:** Unified Resonance Framework & Consciousness Studies
- **ND:** Neurodegeneration & Quantum Biology
- **MP:** Methodological Protocols (e.g., The PVP)
- **GOV:** Governance & Policy Documents

#### 2.2. Type Codes
The `[TYPE]` code specifies the nature of the document.
- **TH:** Theoretical / Hypothesis Paper (Proposing a new model or idea)
- **PR:** Perspective / Review (Synthesizing existing knowledge)
- **RA:** Research Article (Containing original experimental data)
- **PP:** Preprint / Working Paper (A work in progress shared for feedback)
- **TR:** Technical Report / Specification (Detailed mathematical or engineering specs)
- **MA:** Meta-Analysis
- **CP:** Conference Presentation
- **WN:** Working Notes (Internal documentation)
- **IN:** Institute Policy and Procedures (and other official documentation) 

#### 2.3. Year and Sequence
- **[YEAR]:** The four-digit year of the document's initial publication or creation.
- **[SEQ]:** A three-digit sequential number, starting with `001` for the first document of a given type and domain in that year.

### 3. Examples of Application

- **The UCT v10.0 document:** `FI-UCT-TH-2025-001`
- **The URF v10.0 document:** `FI-URF-TH-2025-001`
- **The original Neuromelanin paper:** `FI-ND-TH-2025-001`
- **The Pattern Validation Protocol:** `FI-MP-TR-2025-001`
- **This document itself:** `FI-GOV-IN-2025-001`

### 4. Versioning and Supplementary Materials

- **Revisions:** Minor updates to a document are indicated by appending a lowercase letter to the identifier (e.g., `-a`, `-b`). Major new versions receive a new sequential number or year.
- **Supplementary Materials:** Supplementary files associated with a document are indicated by appending `-S` followed by a number (e.g., `-S1`, `-S2`).

### 5. Internal Topic Tags (Optional)

For internal archival and search purposes, documents can be tagged with optional topic codes appended to the end of the identifier.
- **-NM:** Neuromelanin
- **-MT:** Microtubules
- **-BSW:** Biologically Structured Water
- **-PG:** Positive Geometry

This protocol ensures that the Institute's body of work remains organized, searchable, and professional as it continues to grow.
